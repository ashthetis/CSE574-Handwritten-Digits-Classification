# Handwritten-Digits-Classification
1. Implementation a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and its performance evaluation  in classifying handwritten digits 
2. using the same network to analyze a more challenging face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library
